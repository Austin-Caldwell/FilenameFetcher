Filtering filenames based on a (single) selected filetype extension is supported - Supported filetypes for filtering currently include: *.* (no filter applied), *.docx, *.doc, *.jpeg, *.jpg, and *.pdf. The application also supports exporting the filename list to .txt (text) documents.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn July 2016, Austin Caldwell (@Austin-Caldwell) began work on the \"FilenameFetcher\" (AKA \"Filename Fetcher\") C# Windows Forms application.\r\n",
