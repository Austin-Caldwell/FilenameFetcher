# Filename Fetcher
Filename Fetcher is a C# Windows Forms application with the sole purpose of reading filenames from any given Windows directory and listing only the filenames (without file paths or extensions) of those files.
Filtering filenames based on a (single) selected filetype extension is supported - Supported filetypes for filtering currently include: \*.\* (no filter applied), *.docx, *.doc, *.jpeg, *.jpg, and *.pdf.
The application also supports exporting the filename list to .txt (text) documents.
